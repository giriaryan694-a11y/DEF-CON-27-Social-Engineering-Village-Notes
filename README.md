## About the Repo

The goal of this repository is to make Social Engineering Village learnings accessible to students, professionals, red teamers, and defenders. Rather than raw notes, the summaries here focus on key ideas, tactics, thought processes, and lessons shared by the speakers at DEF CON.

The notes include:

* Real-world social engineering case studies
* OSINT methodology and reconnaissance techniques
* Psychological manipulation principles
* Frameworks for understanding human vulnerabilities
* Organizational risk factors related to insider threats
* Red team social engineering approaches
* Defensive strategies and awareness practices
* Lessons from well-known SE professionals and researchers

Each talk has a dedicated section, making the notes easy to navigate.
