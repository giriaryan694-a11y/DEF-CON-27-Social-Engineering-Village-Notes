        <h1>RED TEAMING FROM DOWN UNDER</h1>
        <h2>Wayne Ronaldson - DEF CON 27 Social Engineering Village<br>Notes By Aryan Giri</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Introduced by Chris Hadnagy, Wayne Ronaldson is noted as the **very first contestant** in the Social Engineering Capture The Flag (SECTF) 10 years prior. Chris distinguishes "real red teaming" (like Wayne's) from standard penetration testing, defining it as long-term (e.g., 90-day) engagements that target the entire business, including supply chains.
        </p>

        <h3>What is Red Teaming?</h3>
        <p>
            Wayne immediately clarifies: <strong>Red Teaming is NOT Pen Testing.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Penetration testing is just one small part of a red team engagement.</li>
            <li>Red Teaming is a <strong>holistic view</strong> of the entire company.</li>
            <li>It requires understanding the business, its competitors, its supply chain, its ethics, and its global operational differences (e.g., an office in the US vs. Australia).</li>
            <li>The term "Red Teaming" is so overused and abused that Wayne now prefers the term <strong>"Adversary Simulation."</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Ideal Red Team Composition</h3>
        <p>
            A successful red team is built on diverse perspectives.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Different Life Experiences:</strong> You cannot have a team of people with the same background. They will all look at the target in the same way.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Roles:</strong> Every member must be able to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Work solo</li>
                    <li>Work in a team</li>
                    <li>Be a leader</li>
                    <li><strong>Be led (no ego)</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Diverse Skills:</strong> A team needs more than just hackers. Wayne has used:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Psychologists:</strong> "Who is the best person that knows people? A psychologist. That's their job." They help craft phishing emails and profile targets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Doctors:</strong> They are not just for emergencies; they provide a completely different view of people and business processes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Engagement: Worldwide Defense Contractor (3.5 Months)</h3>
        <p>
            This talk covers one part of a 3.5-month engagement.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Client:</strong> Worldwide Defense Contractor.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Simulate a real-world, global attack on the business as a whole.</li>
            <li><strong>Scope:</strong> "Whatever the adversary" (Rules of Life), with the exception of murder and kidnapping.</li>
            <li><strong>Target Focus:</strong> Executives, who are time-poor and have access to high-value business intelligence (future plans, M&A) and the supply chain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Case Study 1: The Supply Chain Attack</h3>
        <p>
            The client was confident their third-party supply chain vendor, who managed their external firewalls, was secure.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Wayne called the vendor's 24/7 support line at 12:30 AM.</li>
            <li><strong>Pretext:</strong> "I'm from [client company], I need to change a firewall rule. What's the process?"</li>
            <li><strong>The Hook:</strong> The vendor rep said, "I need an email from you and an email from your boss."</li>
            <li>Wayne immediately registered a **typosquatted domain** (very similar to the client's).</li>
            <li>He sent one email from his fake employee account and another from his fake "boss" account, CC'ing each other.</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> 20 minutes later, he had a ticket number. At 2:00 AM, he had **RDP (port 3389) opened in and out** of a major defense contractor, giving him full access to their servers from the internet.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Case Study 2: The Multi-Stage Executive Breach</h3>

        <h4>Phase 1: Digital Access (The 2FA Bypass)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Target:</strong> The company's single internet-facing portal: a **Citrix login with 2-Factor Authentication (2FA)**.</li>
            <li><strong>The Attack:</strong> A team member built a tool to intercept and **bypass the 2FA**.</li>
            <li>A phishing email ("critical patches to Intel processors") was sent to just three executives. One clicked.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Finding:</strong> The 2FA bypass was so effective that it **wrote 0 logs to their 25-person SOC**.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Phase 2: Business Intelligence (The Calendar)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Once inside, Wayne goes to two places:
                <ol>
                    <li>The <strong>"Welcome Pack"</strong>: Found by scrolling to the *bottom* of an inbox. It contains portals, links, and sometimes even credentials.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Calendar</strong>: This is the most important.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Find:</strong> A calendar entry for a 12-executive, 2-day off-site meeting to discuss the company's 10-year plan.</li>
            <li><strong>The SE/Physical Flaw:</strong> The execs held the meeting at a restaurant (with wine and beer) because the "food tastes like crap" at their secure facility, breaking all corporate policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Phase 3: Physical Recon & Social Engineering</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Wayne knew all 12 executives' faces from their Outlook profile pictures.</li>
            <li>He called the restaurant. <strong>Pretext 1:</strong> "I'm looking to book a 12-person room. Can I come see it?"</li>
            <li><strong>Response:</strong> "That room is booked for a private, confidential meeting on those dates."</li>
            <li><strong>Pretext 2:</strong> "No problem, I'm in town anyway. Can I just come by and have lunch, and poke my head in the room while they're at lunch just to take a photo for my boss?"</li>
            <li>He arrived, waited for the execs to go downstairs, and a staff member escorted him up to the room.</li>
            <li><strong>Pretext 3 (Re-entry):</strong> He pretended to take a selfie by accident. He ran back to the front desk, "So sorry, I took a photo of myself, my boss will kill me. Can I just run up and be real quick?"</li>
            <li>The staff member let him go up **alone**.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Phase 4: The "Jackpot" (Unsupervised Access)</h4>
        <p>
            In the room, Wayne found:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>12 executive laptops, all open and <strong>unlocked</strong>.</li>
            <li>The main presentation laptop, also <strong>unlocked</strong>.</li>
            <li>Handwritten notes from the 10-year planning meeting all over the desk.</li>
            <li>Multiple USB sticks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In 15-20 minutes, he <strong>"owned all 12" laptops</strong>, took photos of all the notes, copied all the USBs, and planted implants on them.
        </p>

        <h4>Phase 5: The USB Drop</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The execs had 4-hour parking and had to come down to move their cars.</li>
            <li>Wayne watched one exec re-park his car and dropped a malicious USB stick right by the driver's side door.</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> The executive picked it up and plugged it in. "It's really silly that this still works."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Demo: Overwatch Offensive</h3>
        <p>
            Wayne demoed his custom tool, "Overwatch Offensive."
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is <strong>NOT</strong> a replacement for tools like Cobalt Strike.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> It is used for special, high-value targets to gather **long-term business intelligence**.</li>
            <li>It does not move laterally.</li>
            <li>It uses extremely long callback times (<strong>48-72 hours or more</strong>) to evade detection.</li>
            <li>The demo showed it can take screenshots and, most notably, <strong>play audio recordings</strong> captured from the target's microphone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rules of Engagement (from Q&A)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Client Contact:</strong> Wayne is in **100% constant, live contact** with a trusted agent inside the organization, telling them exactly what is happening as it happens.</li>
            <li><strong>Police:</strong> If approached by law enforcement (not a security guard), he will try his pretext *once*. If they question him a second time, he **"lets the cat out of the bag" immediately.**</li>
            <li><strong>Priority #1 is safety:</strong> Safety of his team, himself, and the client.</li>
        </ul>
